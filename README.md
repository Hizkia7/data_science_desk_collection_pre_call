# Desk Collection Prediction System

The **Desk Collection Prediction System** is a machine learning-based solution designed to enhance debt collection strategies by predicting customer repayment behavior. Built and deployed on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** using **Vertex AI**, this system prioritizes which debtors should be contacted or re-contacted, enabling more efficient and effective collection efforts.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This system comprises two predictive models integrated into a fully automated ML pipeline:

- **Pre-Call Model**:  
  Predicts a customer's likelihood to make a payment before a call, using loan portfolio and historical repayment data.

- **After-Call Model**:  
  Refines the prediction based on real-time telephony interaction data from collection calls.

By leveraging these insights, desk collection teams can prioritize high-impact actions and improve collection rates.
